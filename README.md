# Daily Mood Tracker MVP

This makes it hard to understand emotional patterns.

- select a mood for the day;
- save the entry;
- view a list of previous mood records.

## Stakeholders
- End user

- GitHub platform

## Goal of the First Iteration
To create an MVP that allows users to quickly record their daily mood.

## Definition of Success

- The main user scenario works consistently
